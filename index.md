## **My favorite quote**
_My recent favorite quote is :_
> This ends here and now

_which is from the latest Thor movie, and I often use it first thing I get up in the morning and whenever I start to do a homework._

## **Programming**
_It's quite tough for me to restart programming while having a 2 year-gap, since I had a little time struggling with basic commands from `git'_
```
git clone
git checkout
git push
...
```
_I had to google these commands to refresh my brain, and fortunately, after googling I think my brain still remembers these things and I just need to review and practice more._
